# Deployment of FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) on the AWS with AWS Transit Gateway Connect integration
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM on AWS with Transit Gateway Connect.  It will create GRE tunnel with the Transit Gateway Connect attachment.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Terraform Provider AWS >= 3.63.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* FOS Version >= 7.0

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - 3 AWS VPCs
        - Customer VPC with 1 app subnet 
           - 1 Internet Gateway
           - 1 Route table with app subnet association, and default route with target to Transit Gateway.
        - Customer VPC with 1 app subnet 
           - 1 Internet Gateway
           - 1 Route table with app subnet association, and default route with target to Transit Gateway.
        - FGT VPC with 1 public, 1 private, 1 gwlb, and 1 transit gateway subnet in one AZ.  And, have two different AZs. 
           - 1 Internet Gateway
           - 1 Route table with private subnet association.
           - 1 Route table with public subnet association, 1 default route with target to Internet Gateway.
           - 1 Route table with transit gateway subnet association.
   - One FortiGate-VM instance with 2 NICs : port1 on public subnet and port2 on private subnet in one AZ.
           - A GRE interface will be created to connect with the Transit Gateway connect.
   - Two Network Security Group rules: one for external, one for internal.
   - One Transit Gateway 
           - Connect attachment to FGT VPC.
           - VPC attachment to FGT VPC(fgt transit subnet az1).
           - VPC attachment to Customer VPC(cs app subnet az1).
           - VPC attachment to Customer2 VPC(cs2 app subnet az1).

## Topology overview
Customer VPC (192.168.50.0/24)
       cs app subnet az1  (192.168.50.128/25)
Customer 2 VPC (192.168.100.0/24)
       cs2 app subnet az1  (192.168.100.128/25)
FortiGate Security VPC (10.0.0.0/24)
       fgt public subnet az1   (10.0.0.0/28)
       fgt private subnet az1  (10.0.0.16/28)
       fgt transit subnet az1  (10.0.0.32/28)

FortiGate VM is deployed in Security VPC.
Server(s) deployed in the app subnet in the Customer VPC and Customer 2 VPC.

Ingress traffic to the Server(s) located in the App subnet in Customer VPC/Customer 2 VPC will be routed to FGT in the security VPC. 
Egress traffic(North/South) from the Server(s) located in the App subnet in Customer VPC/Customer 2 VPC will be routed to Transit Gateway, then through Connect, and redirect to FortiGate-VM's gre interface and send back out to port1.
East/West traffic between each Customer VPC will be routed to the transit gateway, and then through Connect.  Then redirected to FortiGate-VM's GRE interface, and then back out the GRE interface, then to the destinated VPC.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

Customer2VPC = "<Customer 2 VPC>"
CustomerVPC = "<Customer 1 VPC>"
FGT-Password = "<FGT Password>"
FGTPublicIP = "<FGT Public IP>"
FGTVPC = "<FGT Security VPC>"
TransitGwy = "<Transit Gateway ID>"
Username = "<FGT Username>"

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
