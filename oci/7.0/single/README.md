# Deployment of a single FortiGate-VM on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a single FortiGate-VM on OCI

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider OCI >= 4.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* A [OCI API key](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm)

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following :
   - A Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) with one public subnet
   - A VCN with one private subnet
   - A FortiGate-VM instance with two NICs, one in each subnet
   - Two firewall rules: one for the external subnet, and one for the internal subnet

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to OCI:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Move the OCI API key and FortiGate-VM license file to the same folder
3. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
5. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
5. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
6. Verify output.
7. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
8. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

Default_Password = [
  "<FGT Password>",
]
Default_Username = admin
PublicIP = [
  "<FGT Public IP>",
]

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
