# Deployment of a single FortiGate-VM on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM HA Cluster on OCI with 3 ports setup

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.9
* Terraform Provider OCI >= 4.50
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* A [OCI API key](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm)

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - A Virtual Cloud Network (VPC) with two public subnets
   - A VCN with one private subnets
   - Two FortiGate-VM instances with 3 NICs.  hamgmt/sync, untrust, and trust 
   - Four firewall rules: one for external, one for internal, one for sync/HA management.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VMs to OCI:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Move the OCI API key and FortiGate-VM license file to the same folder
3. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
4. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
5. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
6. Verify output.
7. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
8. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
ClusterPublicIP = <FGT Public IP>
Default_Password = [
  "<FGT Password>",
]
Default_Username = admin
FGTActiveMGMTPublicIP = [
  "<FGT Active Public IP>",
]
FGTPassiveMGMTPublicIP = [
  "<FGT Passive Public IP>",
]
```
*After deployment, FortiGate-VM instances may not get the proper configurations during the initial bootstrap configuration. 
User may need to do a manual factoryreset on the units in order to get proper configurations.  To do a factoryreset, user can
login to the units via Console, and do `exec factoryreset` on each of the units*

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
